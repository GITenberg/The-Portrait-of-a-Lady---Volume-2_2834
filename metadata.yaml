description: The Portrait of a Lady is a novel by Henry James, first published as
  a serial in The Atlantic Monthly and Macmillan's Magazine in 1880-81 and then as
  a book in 1881. It is one of James's most popular long novels, and is regarded by
  critics as one of his finest. The Portrait of a Lady is the story of a spirited
  young American woman, Isabel Archer, who "affronts her destiny" and finds it overwhelming.
  She inherits a large amount of money and subsequently becomes the victim of Machiavellian
  scheming by two American expatriates.
